Note that if you're on a browser that\n* does not natively support the [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)\n* object, you must load the polyfill yourself. An example polyfill can\n* be found [here](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/).\n*\n* `Polymer.AppLocalizeBehavior` supports the same [message-syntax](http://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/)\n* of format.js, in its entirety; use the library docs as reference for the\n* available message formats and options.\n*\n* Sample application loading resources from an external file:\n*\n*     <dom-module id=\"x-app\">\n*        <template>\n*         <div>{{localize('hello', 'name', 'Batman')}}</div>\n*        </template>\n*        <script>\n*           Polymer({\n*             is: \"x-app\",\n*\n*             behaviors: [\n*               Polymer.AppLocalizeBehavior\n*             ],\n*\n*             properties: {\n*               language: {\n*                 value: 'en'\n*               },\n*             }\n*\n*             attached: function() {\n*               this.loadResources(this.resolveUrl('locales.json'));\n*             },\n*           });\n*        &lt;/script>\n*     </dom-module>\n*\n*\n* If the resources stored in your external file are for a single language and\n* so are not nested inside any language keys, you can pass an optional\n* `language` parameter to store the fetched resources inside that key.\n*\n* This complements the optional third parameter, `merge`, nicely: If you pass\n* `merge = true`, the fetched resources will be merged into any existing\n* resources rather than clobbering them.\n*\n* This is also useful for storing resources for different parts of a page that\n* the user might or might not see at the same time in different files, so that\n* the user can fetch only the needed resources on-demand, and doesn't have to\n* load any resources they'll never see anyway. For example, you could store\n* your resources for your global nav, homepage, and FAQ page in 3 different\n* files. When a user requests the homepage, both the global nav and the\n* homepage resources are fetched and merged together, since they both appear\n* on the page at the same time, but you spare the user from fetching the\n* unneeded FAQ resources.\n*\n*\n* Example:\n*\n*     attached: function() {\n*       this.loadResources(\n*\n*         // Only contains the flattened \"es\" translations:\n*         'locales/es.json',  // {\"hi\": \"hola\"}\n*\n*         'es',               // unflatten -> {\"es\": {\"hi\": \"hola\"}}\n*\n*         true                // merge so existing resources won't be clobbered\n*       );\n*     }\n*\n*\n* Alternatively, you can also inline your resources inside the app itself:\n*\n*     <dom-module id=\"x-app\">\n*        <template>\n*         <div>{{localize('hello', 'name', 'Batman')}}</div>\n*        </template>\n*        <script>\n*           Polymer({\n*             is: \"x-app\",\n*\n*             behaviors: [\n*               Polymer.AppLocalizeBehavior\n*             ],\n*\n*             properties: {\n*               language: {\n*                 value: 'en'\n*               },\n*               resources: {\n*                 value: function() {\n*                   return {\n*                     'en': { 'hello': 'My name is {name}.' },\n*                     'fr': { 'hello': 'Je m\\'appelle {name}.' }\n*                   }\n*               }\n*             }\n*           });\n*        &lt;/script>\n*     </dom-module>\n*\n* @demo demo/index.html\n* @polymerBehavior Polymer.AppLocalizeBehavior\n*/\nexport const AppLocalizeBehavior = {\n  /**\n   * Internal singleton cache.

Instancing the class will result in the\n * template being stamped into a document fragment stored as the instance's\n * `root` property, after which it can be appended to the DOM.\n *\n * Templates may utilize all Polymer data-binding features as well as\n * declarative event listeners.  Event listeners and inline computing\n * functions in the template will be called on the host of the template.\n *\n * The constructor returned takes a single argument dictionary of initial\n * property values to propagate into template bindings.  Additionally\n * host properties can be forwarded in, and instance properties can be\n * notified out by providing optional callbacks in the `options` dictionary.\n *\n * Valid configuration in `options` are as follows:\n *\n * - `forwardHostProp(property, value)`: Called when a property referenced\n *   in the template changed on the template's host. As this library does\n *   not retain references to templates instanced by the user, it is the\n *   templatize owner's responsibility to forward host property changes into\n *   user-stamped instances.  The `instance.forwardHostProp(property, value)`\n *    method on the generated class should be called to forward host\n *   properties into the template to prevent unnecessary property-changed\n *   notifications. Any properties referenced in the template that are not\n *   defined in `instanceProps` will be notified up to the template's host\n *   automatically.\n * - `instanceProps`: Dictionary of property names that will be added\n *   to the instance by the templatize owner.  These properties shadow any\n *   host properties, and changes within the template to these properties\n *   will result in `notifyInstanceProp` being called.\n * - `mutableData`: When `true`, the generated class will skip strict\n *   dirty-checking for objects and arrays (always consider them to be\n *   \"dirty\").\n * - `notifyInstanceProp(instance, property, value)`: Called when\n *   an instance property changes.  Users may choose to call `notifyPath`\n *   on e.g. the owner to notify the change.\n * - `parentModel`: When `true`, events handled by declarative event listeners\n *   (`on-event=\"handler\"`) will be decorated with a `model` property pointing\n *   to the template instance that stamped it.  It will also be returned\n *   from `instance.parentModel` in cases where template instance nesting\n *   causes an inner model to shadow an outer model.\n *\n * All callbacks are called bound to the `owner`. Any context\n * needed for the callbacks (such as references to `instances` stamped)\n * should be stored on the `owner` such that they can be retrieved via\n * `this`.\n *\n * When `options.forwardHostProp` is declared as an option, any properties\n * referenced in the template will be automatically forwarded from the host of\n * the `<template>` to instances, with the exception of any properties listed in\n * the `options.instanceProps` object.  `instanceProps` are assumed to be\n * managed by the owner of the instances, either passed into the constructor\n * or set after the fact.  Note, any properties passed into the constructor will\n * always be set to the instance (regardless of whether they would normally\n * be forwarded from the host).\n *\n * Note that `templatize()` can be run only once for a given `<template>`.\n * Further calls will result in an error. Also, there is a special\n * behavior if the template was duplicated through a mechanism such as\n * `<dom-repeat>` or `<test-fixture>`. In this case, all calls to\n * `templatize()` return the same class for all duplicates of a template.\n * The class returned from `templatize()` is generated only once using\n * the `options` from the first call. This means that any `options`\n * provided to subsequent calls will be ignored. Therefore, it is very\n * important not to close over any variables inside the callbacks. Also,\n * arrow functions must be avoided because they bind the outer `this`.\n * Inside the callbacks, any contextual information can be accessed\n * through `this`, which points to the `owner`.\n *\n * @param {!HTMLTemplateElement} template Template to templatize\n * @param {Polymer_PropertyEffects=} owner Owner of the template instances;\n *   any optional callbacks will be bound to this owner.\n * @param {Object=} options Options dictionary (see summary for details)\n * @return {function(new:TemplateInstanceBase)} Generated class bound to the template\n *   provided\n * @suppress {invalidCasts}\n */\nexport function templatize(template, owner, options) {\n  options = /** @type {!TemplatizeOptions} */(options || {});\n  if (template.__templatizeOwner) {\n    throw new Error('A <template> can only be templatized once');\n  }\n  template.__templatizeOwner = owner;\n  const ctor = owner ? owner.constructor : TemplateInstanceBase;\n  let templateInfo = ctor._parseTemplate(template);\n  // Get memoized base class for the prototypical template, which\n  // includes property effects for binding template & forwarding\n  let baseClass = templateInfo.templatizeInstanceClass;\n  if (!baseClass) {\n    baseClass = createTemplatizerClass(template, templateInfo, options);\n    templateInfo.templatizeInstanceClass = baseClass;\n  }\n  // Host property forwarding must be installed onto template instance\n  addPropagateEffects(template, templateInfo, options);\n  // Subclass base class and add reference for this specific template\n  /** @private */\n  let klass = class TemplateInstance extends baseClass {};\n  klass.prototype._methodHost = findMethodHost(template);\n  klass.prototype.__dataHost = template;\n  klass.prototype.__templatizeOwner = owner;\n  klass.prototype.__hostProps = templateInfo.hostProps;\n  klass = /** @type {function(new:TemplateInstanceBase)} */(klass); //eslint-disable-line no-self-assign\n  return klass;\n}\n\n/**\n * Returns the template \"model\" associated with a given element, which\n * serves as the binding scope for the template instance the element is\n * contained in.

This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:\n\n1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nThe layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that\nlet you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file\nin every element that needs to use them.\n\n    Sample use:\n\n    ```\n    <custom-element-demo>\n      <template>\n        <script src=\"../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js\"></script>\n        <next-code-block></next-code-block>\n      </template>\n    </custom-element-demo>\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <link rel=\"import\" href=\"iron-flex-layout-classes.html\">\n    <style is=\"custom-style\" include=\"iron-flex iron-flex-alignment\"></style>\n    <style>\n      .test { width: 100px; }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"layout horizontal center-center\">\n      <div class=\"test\">horizontal layout center alignment</div>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n2. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html).\nThe mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.\n\nPlease note that the old [/deep/ layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes)\nare deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties\ndirectly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based\n[layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nPlease note that the new version does not use `/deep/`, and therefore requires you\nto import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.\n\nA complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available.\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@pseudoElement iron-flex-layout\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

This is accomplished by changing the property set to this:\n *\n *    --foo_-_border: 2px solid red;\n *    --foo_-_color: initial;\n *    --foo_-_background: initial;\n *\n * This works but introduces one new issue.\n * Consider this setup at the point where the `@apply` is used:\n *\n *    background: orange;\n *    `@apply` --foo;\n *\n * In this case the background will be unset (initial) rather than the desired\n * `orange`. We address this by altering the property set to use a fallback\n * value like this:\n *\n *    color: var(--foo_-_color);\n *    background: var(--foo_-_background, orange);\n *    border: var(--foo_-_border);\n *\n * Note that the default is retained in the property set and the `background` is\n * the desired `orange`. This leads us to a limitation.\n *\n * Limitation 1:\n\n * Only properties in the rule where the `@apply`\n * is used are considered as default values.\n * If another rule matches the element and sets `background` with\n * less specificity than the rule in which `@apply` appears,\n * the `background` will not be set.\n *\n * Limitation 2:\n *\n * When using Polymer's `updateStyles` api, new

You can use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension\n[like x-meta] for enhancements).\n\nThe `iron-meta` instances containing your actual data can be loaded in an import,\nor constructed in any way you see fit. The only requirement is that you create them\nbefore you try to access them.\n\nExamples:\n\nIf I create an instance like this:\n\n    <iron-meta key=\"info\" value=\"foo/bar\"></iron-meta>\n\nNote that value=\"foo/bar\" is the metadata I've defined. I could define more\nattributes or use child nodes to define additional metadata.\n\nNow I can access that element (and it's metadata) from any iron-meta instance\nvia the byKey method, e.g.\n\n    meta.byKey('info');\n\nPure imperative form would be like:\n\n    document.createElement('iron-meta').byKey('info');\n\nOr, in a Polymer element, you can include a meta in your template:\n\n    <iron-meta id=\"meta\"></iron-meta>\n    ...\n    this.$.meta.byKey('info');\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@demo demo/index.html\n@hero hero.svg\n@element iron-meta\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

hidden or\n  shown, and displays on top of other content. It includes an optional backdrop,\n  and can be used to implement a variety of UI controls including dialogs and drop\n  downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.\n\n  See the [demo source\n  code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)\n  for an example.\n\n  ### Closing and canceling\n\n  An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close\n  and cancel is user intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged\n  the content on the overlay. By default, it will cancel whenever the user taps\n  outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is configurable with the\n  `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.\n  `close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts\n  with a control in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay\n  fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled' event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to\n  prevent the overlay from closing.\n\n  ### Positioning\n\n  By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the\n  window. You can position and size it manually using CSS. See\n  `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.\n\n  ### Backdrop\n\n  Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The\n  backdrop is appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See\n  its doc page for styling options.\n\n  In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light\n  DOM. Override the [`_focusableNodes`\n  getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes) to achieve a\n  different behavior.\n\n  ### Limitations\n\n  The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index`\n  property. You must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher\n  `z-index` than its parent stacking context.

When the user touches the button, a ripple effect emanates\nfrom the point of contact. It may be flat or raised. A raised button is styled with a\nshadow.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-button>Flat button</paper-button>\n    <paper-button raised>Raised button</paper-button>\n    <paper-button noink>No ripple effect</paper-button>\n    <paper-button toggles>Toggle-able button</paper-button>\n\nA button that has `toggles` true will remain `active` after being clicked (and\nwill have an `active` attribute set). For more information, see the `Polymer.IronButtonState`\nbehavior.\n\nYou may use custom DOM in the button body to create a variety of buttons. For example, to\ncreate a button with an icon and some text:\n\n    <paper-button>\n      <iron-icon icon=\"favorite\"></iron-icon>\n      custom button content\n    </paper-button>\n\nTo use `paper-button` as a link, wrap it in an anchor tag. Since `paper-button` will already\nreceive focus, you may want to prevent the anchor tag from receiving focus as well by setting\nits tabindex to -1.\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.polymer-project.org/\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n      <paper-button raised>Polymer Project</paper-button>\n    </a>\n\n### Styling\n\nStyle the button with CSS as you would a normal DOM element.\n\n    paper-button.fancy {\n      background: green;\n      color: yellow;\n    }\n\n    paper-button.fancy:hover {\n      background: lime;\n    }\n\n    paper-button[disabled],\n    paper-button[toggles][active] {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\nBy default, the ripple is the same color as the foreground at 25% opacity. You may\ncustomize the color using the `--paper-button-ink-color` custom property.\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-button-ink-color` | Background color of the ripple | `Based on the button's color`\n`--paper-button` | Mixin applied to the button | `{}`\n`--paper-button-disabled` | Mixin applied to the disabled button. Note that you can also use the `paper-button[disabled]` selector | `{}`\n`--paper-button-flat-keyboard-focus` | Mixin applied to a flat button after it's been focused using the keyboard | `{}`\n`--paper-button-raised-keyboard-focus` | Mixin applied to a raised button after it's been focused using the keyboard | `{}`\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

By default an icon renders as a 24px square.\n\nExample using src:\n\n    <iron-icon src=\"star.png\"></iron-icon>\n\nExample setting size to 32px x 32px:\n\n    <iron-icon class=\"big\" src=\"big_star.png\"></iron-icon>\n\n    <style is=\"custom-style\">\n      .big {\n        --iron-icon-height: 32px;\n        --iron-icon-width: 32px;\n      }\n    </style>\n\nThe iron elements include several sets of icons.\nTo use the default set of icons, import `iron-icons.html` and use the `icon` attribute to specify an icon:\n\n    <link rel=\"import\" href=\"/components/iron-icons/iron-icons.html\">\n\n    <iron-icon icon=\"menu\"></iron-icon>\n\nTo use a different built-in set of icons, import the specific `iron-icons/<iconset>-icons.html`, and\nspecify the icon as `<iconset>:<icon>`. For example, to use a communication icon, you would\nuse:\n\n    <link rel=\"import\" href=\"/components/iron-icons/communication-icons.html\">\n\n    <iron-icon icon=\"communication:email\"></iron-icon>\n\nYou can also create custom icon sets of bitmap or SVG icons.\n\nExample of using an icon named `cherry` from a custom iconset with the ID `fruit`:\n\n    <iron-icon icon=\"fruit:cherry\"></iron-icon>\n\nSee [iron-iconset](iron-iconset) and [iron-iconset-svg](iron-iconset-svg) for more information about\nhow to create a custom iconset.\n\nSee the [iron-icons demo](iron-icons?view=demo:demo/index.html) to see the icons available\nin the various iconsets.\n\nTo load a subset of icons from one of the default `iron-icons` sets, you can\nuse the [poly-icon](https://poly-icon.appspot.com/) tool. It allows you\nto select individual icons, and creates an iconset from them that you can\nuse directly in your elements.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--iron-icon` | Mixin applied to the icon | {}\n`--iron-icon-width` | Width of the icon | `24px`\n`--iron-icon-height` | Height of the icon | `24px`\n`--iron-icon-fill-color` | Fill color of the svg icon | `currentcolor`\n`--iron-icon-stroke-color` | Stroke color of the svg icon | none\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@element iron-icon\n@demo demo/index.html\n@hero hero.svg\n@homepage polymer.github.io\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

The model should be used to manipulate data on the\n * instance, for example `event.model.set('item.checked', true);`.\n *\n * Alternatively, the model for a template instance for an element stamped by\n * a `dom-repeat` can be obtained using the `modelForElement` API on the\n * `dom-repeat` that stamped it, for example\n * `this.$.domRepeat.modelForElement(event.target).set('item.checked', true);`.\n * This may be useful for manipulating instance data of event targets obtained\n * by event handlers on parents of the `dom-repeat` (event delegation).\n *\n * A view-specific filter/sort may be applied to each `dom-repeat` by supplying a\n * `filter` and/or `sort` property.  This may be a string that names a function on\n * the host, or a function may be assigned to the property directly.

The\neffect can be visualized as a concentric circle with motion.\n\nExample:\n\n    <div style=\"position:relative\">\n      <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>\n    </div>\n\nNote, it's important that the parent container of the ripple be relative position, otherwise\nthe ripple will emanate outside of the desired container.\n\n`paper-ripple` listens to \"mousedown\" and \"mouseup\" events so it would display ripple\neffect when touches on it.  You can also defeat the default behavior and\nmanually route the down and up actions to the ripple element.  Note that it is\nimportant if you call `downAction()` you will have to make sure to call\n`upAction()` so that `paper-ripple` would end the animation loop.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-ripple id=\"ripple\" style=\"pointer-events: none;\"></paper-ripple>\n    ...\n    downAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.downAction(e.detail);\n    },\n    upAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.upAction();\n    }\n\nStyling ripple effect:\n\n  Use CSS color property to style the ripple:\n\n    paper-ripple {\n      color: #4285f4;\n    }\n\n  Note that CSS color property is inherited so it is not required to set it on\n  the `paper-ripple` element directly.\n\nBy default, the ripple is centered on the point of contact.  Apply the `recenters`\nattribute to have the ripple grow toward the center of its container.\n\n    <paper-ripple recenters></paper-ripple>\n\nYou can also  center the ripple inside its container from the start.\n\n    <paper-ripple center></paper-ripple>\n\nApply `circle` class to make the rippling effect within a circle.\n\n    <paper-ripple class=\"circle\"></paper-ripple>\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-ripple\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

You can configure\nthe attribute it listens to with the `attr-for-value` attribute.\n\n### Using a custom input element\n\nYou can use a custom input element in a `<paper-input-container>`, for example to implement a\ncompound input field like a social security number input. The custom input element should have the\n`paper-input-input` class, have a `notify:true` value property and optionally implements\n`Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior` if it is validatable.\n\n    <paper-input-container attr-for-value=\"ssn-value\">\n      <label slot=\"label\">Social security number</label>\n      <ssn-input slot=\"input\" class=\"paper-input-input\"></ssn-input>\n    </paper-input-container>\n\n\nIf you're using a `<paper-input-container>` imperatively, it's important to make sure\nthat you attach its children (the `iron-input` and the optional `label`) before you\nattach the `<paper-input-container>` itself, so that it can be set up correctly.\n\n### Validation\n\nIf the `auto-validate` attribute is set, the input container will validate the input and update\nthe container styling when the input value changes.\n\n### Add-ons\n\nAdd-ons are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `add-on` attribute and\nimplements the `Polymer.PaperInputAddonBehavior` behavior. They are notified when the input value\nor validity changes, and may implement functionality such as error messages or character counters.\nThey appear at the bottom of the input.\n\n### Prefixes and suffixes\nThese are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `prefix`\nor `suffix` attribute, and are displayed inline with the input, before or after.\n\n    <paper-input-container>\n      <div slot=\"prefix\">$</div>\n      <label slot=\"label\">Total</label>\n      <iron-input slot=\"input\">\n        <input>\n      </iron-input>\n      // In Polymer 1.0, you would use `<input is=\"iron-input\" slot=\"input\">` instead of the above.\n      <paper-icon-button slot=\"suffix\" icon=\"clear\"></paper-icon-button>\n    </paper-input-container>\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-input-container-color` | Label and underline color when the input is not focused | `--secondary-text-color`\n`--paper-input-container-focus-color` | Label and underline color when the input is focused | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-input-container-invalid-color` | Label and underline color when the input is is invalid | `--error-color`\n`--paper-input-container-input-color` | Input foreground color | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-input-container` | Mixin applied to the container | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-disabled` | Mixin applied to the container when it's disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-label-focus` | Mixin applied to the label when the input is focused | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-label-floating` | Mixin applied to the label when floating | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input` | Mixin applied to the input | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input-disabled` | Mixin applied to the input when the component is disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input-focus` | Mixin applied to the input when focused | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input-invalid` | Mixin applied to the input when invalid | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input-webkit-spinner` | Mixin applied to the webkit spinner | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input-webkit-clear` | Mixin applied to the webkit clear button | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator` | Mixin applied to the webkit calendar picker indicator | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-ms-clear` | Mixin applied to the Internet Explorer clear button | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-underline` | Mixin applied to the underline | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-underline-focus` | Mixin applied to the underline when the input is focused | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-underline-disabled` | Mixin applied to the underline when the input is disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-input-prefix` | Mixin applied to the input prefix | `{}`\n`--paper-input-suffix` | Mixin applied to the input suffix | `{}`\n\nThis element is `display:block` by default, but you can set the `inline` attribute to make it\n`display:inline-block`.\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

To use it, you must distribute a native `<input>`\nyourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would normally:\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input type=\"email\" disabled>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Two-way binding\n\nBy default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`\ndue to user input:\n\n    <input value=\"{{myValue::input}}\">\n\nThis means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value = 'foo'`),\nno events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.\n\n`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s '`value` property; this\nproperty can be used for two-way data binding.\n`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.\n\n    <iron-input bind-value=\"{{myValue}}\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\nNote: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you _must_\nset `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be notified.\n\n### Validation\n\n`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`\nhas a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed `input`'s\nvalidity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for styling.\n\nTo validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate` attribute.\n\n`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is\ncalled. You can use it to implement a custom validator:\n\n    var CatsOnlyValidator = {\n      validate: function(ironInput) {\n        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';\n        ironInput.invalid = !valid;\n        return valid;\n      }\n    }\n    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {\n      CatsOnly.validate(input2);\n    });\n\nYou can also use an element implementing an [`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).\nThis example can also be found in the demo for this element:\n\n    <iron-input validator=\"cats-only\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Preventing invalid input\n\nIt may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use the\n`allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature\nis separate from validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is validated.\n\n    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.\n    <iron-input allowed-pattern=\"[0-9]\">\n      <input pattern=\"\\d{5}\">\n    </iron-input>\n\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

We expect it will need some changes. We're counting on your feedback!*\n\nIn its typical usage, a `app-route` element consumes an object that describes\nsome state about the current route, via the `route` property. It then parses\nthat state using the `pattern` property, and produces two artifacts: some `data`\nrelated to the `route`, and a `tail` that contains the rest of the `route` that\ndid not match.\n\nHere is a basic example, when used with `app-location`:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:page\"\n        data=\"{{data}}\"\n        tail=\"{{tail}}\">\n    </app-route>\n\nIn the above example, the `app-location` produces a `route` value. Then, the\n`route.path` property is matched by comparing it to the `pattern` property. If\nthe `pattern` property matches `route.path`, the `app-route` will set or update\nits `data` property with an object whose properties correspond to the parameters\nin `pattern`. So, in the above example, if `route.path` was `'/about'`, the value\nof `data` would be `{\"page\": \"about\"}`.\n\nThe `tail` property represents the remaining part of the route state after the\n`pattern` has been applied to a matching `route`.\n\nHere is another example, where `tail` is used:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:page\"\n        data=\"{{routeData}}\"\n        tail=\"{{subroute}}\">\n    </app-route>\n    <app-route\n        route=\"{{subroute}}\"\n        pattern=\"/:id\"\n        data=\"{{subrouteData}}\">\n    </app-route>\n\nIn the above example, there are two `app-route` elements. The first\n`app-route` consumes a `route`. When the `route` is matched, the first\n`app-route` also produces `routeData` from its `data`, and `subroute` from\nits `tail`. The second `app-route` consumes the `subroute`, and when it\nmatches, it produces an object called `subrouteData` from its `data`.\n\nSo, when `route.path` is `'/about'`, the `routeData` object will look like\nthis: `{ page: 'about' }`\n\nAnd `subrouteData` will be null. However, if `route.path` changes to\n`'/article/123'`, the `routeData` object will look like this:\n`{ page: 'article' }`\n\nAnd the `subrouteData` will look like this: `{ id: '123' }`\n\n`app-route` is responsive to bi-directional changes to the `data` objects\nthey produce. So, if `routeData.page` changed from `'article'` to `'about'`,\nthe `app-route` will update `route.path`.

They give users a quick sense of how much longer an operation\nwill take.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-progress value=\"10\"></paper-progress>\n\nThere is also a secondary progress which is useful for displaying intermediate\nprogress, such as the buffer level during a streaming playback progress bar.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-progress value=\"10\" secondary-progress=\"30\"></paper-progress>\n\n### Styling progress bar:\n\nTo change the active progress bar color:\n\n    paper-progress {\n       --paper-progress-active-color: #e91e63;\n    }\n\nTo change the secondary progress bar color:\n\n    paper-progress {\n      --paper-progress-secondary-color: #f8bbd0;\n    }\n\nTo change the progress bar background color:\n\n    paper-progress {\n      --paper-progress-container-color: #64ffda;\n    }\n\nAdd the class `transiting` to a paper-progress to animate the progress bar when\nthe value changed.

The currently selected\nitem is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label` is\ndisplayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an [`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect)\nevent when a child is deselected. The selected or deselected item must\nbe passed as the event's `detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | A mixin that is applied to the internal paper input | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n\nYou can also use any of the `paper-input-container` and `paper-menu-button`\nstyle mixins and custom properties to style the internal input and menu button\nrespectively.\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-dropdown-menu\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

For example:\n *\n * ```html\n *  <link rel=\"import\"\n * href=\"/bower_components/app-layout/app-scroll-effects/effects/waterfall.html\">\n * ```\n *\n * ### Consuming effects\n *\n * Effects can be consumed via the `effects` property. For example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"></app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Creating scroll effects\n *\n * You may want to create a custom scroll effect if you need to modify the CSS\n * of an element based on the scroll position.\n *\n * A scroll effect definition is an object with `setUp()`, `tearDown()` and\n * `run()` functions.\n *\n * To register the effect, you can use\n * `Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect(effectName, effectDef)` For example, let's\n * define an effect that resizes the header's logo:\n *\n * ```js\n * Polymer.AppLayout.registerEffect('resizable-logo', {\n *   setUp: function(config) {\n *     // the effect's config is passed to the setUp.\n *     this._fxResizeLogo = { logo: Polymer.dom(this).querySelector('[logo]') };\n *   },\n *\n *   run: function(progress) {\n *      // the progress of the effect\n *      this.transform('scale3d(' + progress + ', '+ progress +', 1)',\n * this._fxResizeLogo.logo);\n *   },\n *\n *   tearDown: function() {\n *      // clean up and reset of states\n *      delete this._fxResizeLogo;\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n * Now, you can consume the effect:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header id=\"appHeader\" effects=\"resizable-logo\">\n *   <img logo src=\"logo.svg\">\n * </app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Imperative API\n *\n * ```js\n * var logoEffect = appHeader.createEffect('resizable-logo', effectConfig);\n * // run the effect: logoEffect.run(progress);\n * // tear down the effect: logoEffect.tearDown();\n * ```\n *\n * ### Configuring effects\n *\n * For effects installed via the `effects` property, their configuration can be\n * set via the `effectsConfig` property. For example:\n *\n * ```html\n * <app-header effects=\"waterfall\"\n *   effects-config='{\"waterfall\": {\"startsAt\": 0, \"endsAt\": 0.5}}'>\n * </app-header>\n * ```\n *\n * All effects have a `startsAt` and `endsAt` config property. They specify at\n * what point the effect should start and end. This value goes from 0 to 1\n * inclusive.\n *\n * @polymerBehavior\n */\nexport const AppScrollEffectsBehavior = [\n  IronScrollTargetBehavior,\n  {\n\n    properties: {\n\n      /**\n       * A space-separated list of the effects names that will be triggered when\n       * the user scrolls. e.g. `waterfall parallax-background` installs the\n       * `waterfall` and `parallax-background`.\n       */\n      effects: {type: String},\n\n      /**\n       * An object that configurates the effects installed via the `effects`\n       * property. e.g.\n       * ```js\n       *  element.effectsConfig = {\n       *   \"blend-background\": {\n       *     \"startsAt\": 0.5\n       *   }\n       * };\n       * ```\n       * Every effect has at least two config properties: `startsAt` and\n       * `endsAt`.

By default, an app-header moves away from the viewport when scrolling down and\nif using `reveals`, the header slides back when scrolling back up. For example:\n\n```html\n<app-header reveals>\n  <app-toolbar>\n    <div main-title>App name</div>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\napp-header can also condense when scrolling down. To achieve this behavior, the header\nmust have a larger height than the `sticky` element in the light DOM. For example:\n\n```html\n<app-header style=\"height: 96px;\" condenses fixed>\n  <app-toolbar style=\"height: 64px;\">\n    <div main-title>App name</div>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\nIn this case the header is initially `96px` tall, and it shrinks to `64px` when scrolling down.\nThat is what is meant by \"condensing\".\n\n### Sticky element\n\nThe element that is positioned fixed to top of the header's `scrollTarget` when a threshold\nis reached, similar to `position: sticky` in CSS. This element **must** be an immediate\nchild of app-header. By default, the `sticky` element is the first `app-toolbar that\nis an immediate child of app-header.\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses>\n  <app-toolbar> Sticky element </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n#### Customizing the sticky element\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses>\n  <app-toolbar></app-toolbar>\n  <app-toolbar sticky> Sticky element </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n### Scroll target\n\nThe app-header's `scrollTarget` property allows to customize the scrollable element to which\nthe header responds when the user scrolls. By default, app-header uses the document as\nthe scroll target, but you can customize this property by setting the id of the element, e.g.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"scrollingRegion\" style=\"overflow-y: auto;\">\n  <app-header scroll-target=\"scrollingRegion\">\n  </app-header>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this case, the `scrollTarget` property points to the outer div element. Alternatively,\nyou can set this property programmatically:\n\n```js\nappHeader.scrollTarget = document.querySelector(\"#scrollingRegion\");\n```\n\n## Backgrounds\napp-header has two background layers that can be used for styling when the header is condensed\nor when the scrollable element is scrolled to the top.\n\n## Scroll effects\n\nScroll effects are _optional_ visual effects applied in app-header based on scroll position. For example,\nThe [Material Design scrolling techniques](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/scrolling-techniques.html)\nrecommends effects that can be installed via the `effects` property. e.g.\n\n```html\n<app-header effects=\"waterfall\">\n  <app-toolbar>App name</app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n#### Importing the effects\n\nTo use the scroll effects, you must explicitly import them in addition to `app-header`:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"/bower_components/app-layout/app-scroll-effects/app-scroll-effects.html\">\n```\n\n#### List of effects\n\n* **blend-background**\nFades in/out two background elements by applying CSS opacity based on scroll position.\nYou can use this effect to smoothly change the background color or image of the header.\nFor example, using the mixin `--app-header-background-rear-layer` lets you assign a different\nbackground when the header is condensed:\n\n```css\napp-header {\n  background-color: red;\n  --app-header-background-rear-layer: {\n    /* The header is blue when condensed *\\/\n    background-color: blue;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n* **fade-background**\nUpon scrolling past a threshold, this effect will trigger an opacity transition to\nfade in/out the backgrounds. Compared to the `blend-background` effect,\nthis effect doesn't interpolate the opacity based on scroll position.\n\n\n* **parallax-background**\nA simple parallax effect that vertically translates the backgrounds based on a fraction\nof the scroll position. For example:\n\n```css\napp-header {\n  --app-header-background-front-layer: {\n    background-image: url(...);\n  };\n}\n```\n```html\n<app-header style=\"height: 300px;\" effects=\"parallax-background\">\n  <app-toolbar>App name</app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\nThe fraction determines how far the background moves relative to the scroll position.\nThis value can be assigned via the `scalar` config value and it is typically a value\nbetween 0 and 1 inclusive. If `scalar=0`, the background doesn't move away from the header.\n\n* **resize-title**\nProgressively interpolates the size of the title from the element with the `main-title` attribute\nto the element with the `condensed-title` attribute as the header condenses. For example:\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses reveals effects=\"resize-title\">\n  <app-toolbar>\n      <h4 condensed-title>App name</h4>\n  </app-toolbar>\n  <app-toolbar>\n      <h1 main-title>App name</h1>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n* **resize-snapped-title**\nUpon scrolling past a threshold, this effect fades in/out the titles using opacity transitions.\nSimilarly to `resize-title`, the `main-title` and `condensed-title` elements must be placed in the\nlight DOM.\n\n* **waterfall**\nToggles the shadow property in app-header to create a sense of depth (as recommended in the\nMD spec) between the header and the underneath content. You can change the shadow by\ncustomizing the `--app-header-shadow` mixin. For example:\n\n```css\napp-header {\n  --app-header-shadow: {\n    box-shadow: inset 0px 5px 2px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n```html\n<app-header condenses reveals effects=\"waterfall\">\n  <app-toolbar>\n      <h1 main-title>App name</h1>\n  </app-toolbar>\n</app-header>\n```\n\n* **material**\nInstalls the waterfall, resize-title, blend-background and parallax-background effects.\n\n### Content attributes\n\nAttribute | Description         | Default\n----------|---------------------|----------------------------------------\n`sticky` | Element that remains at the top when the header condenses. | The first app-toolbar in the light DOM.\n\n\n## Styling\n\nMixin | Description | Default\n------|-------------|----------\n`--app-header-background-front-layer` | Applies to the front layer of the background. | {}\n`--app-header-background-rear-layer` | Applies to the rear layer of the background. | {}\n`--app-header-shadow` | Applies to the shadow. | {}\n\n@group App Elements\n@element app-header\n@demo app-header/demo/blend-background-1.html Blend Background Image\n@demo app-header/demo/blend-background-2.html Blend 2 Background Images\n@demo app-header/demo/blend-background-3.html Blend Background Colors\n@demo app-header/demo/contacts.html Contacts Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/give.html Resize Snapped Title Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/music.html Reveals Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/no-effects.html Condenses and Reveals Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/notes.html Fixed with Dynamic Shadow Demo\n@demo app-header/demo/custom-sticky-element-1.html Custom Sticky Element Demo 1\n@demo app-header/demo/custom-sticky-element-2.html Custom Sticky Element Demo 2\n\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

In the interim, either the element's CSS `background-color`\ncan be be used as the placeholder, or the `placeholder` property can be\nset to a URL (preferably a data-URI, for instant rendering) for an\nplaceholder image.\n\nThe `fade` option (only valid when `preload` is set) will cause the placeholder\nimage/color to be faded out once the image is rendered.\n\nExamples:\n\n  Basically identical to `<img src=\"...\">` tag:\n\n    <iron-image src=\"http://lorempixel.com/400/400\"></iron-image>\n\n  Will letterbox the image to fit:\n\n    <iron-image style=\"width:400px; height:400px;\" sizing=\"contain\"\n      src=\"http://lorempixel.com/600/400\"></iron-image>\n\n  Will crop the image to fit:\n\n    <iron-image style=\"width:400px; height:400px;\" sizing=\"cover\"\n      src=\"http://lorempixel.com/600/400\"></iron-image>\n\n  Will show light-gray background until the image loads:\n\n    <iron-image style=\"width:400px; height:400px; background-color: lightgray;\"\n      sizing=\"cover\" preload src=\"http://lorempixel.com/600/400\"></iron-image>\n\n  Will show a base-64 encoded placeholder image until the image loads:\n\n    <iron-image style=\"width:400px; height:400px;\" placeholder=\"data:image/gif;base64,...\"\n      sizing=\"cover\" preload src=\"http://lorempixel.com/600/400\"></iron-image>\n\n  Will fade the light-gray background out once the image is loaded:\n\n    <iron-image style=\"width:400px; height:400px; background-color: lightgray;\"\n      sizing=\"cover\" preload fade src=\"http://lorempixel.com/600/400\"></iron-image>\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--iron-image-placeholder` | Mixin applied to #placeholder | `{}`\n`--iron-image-width` | Sets the width of the wrapped image | `auto`\n`--iron-image-height` | Sets the height of the wrapped image | `auto`\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@element iron-image\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

This is a beta release of iron-location as we continue work\non higher level elements, and as such iron-location may undergo breaking\nchanges.\n\n#### Properties\n\nWhen the URL is: `/search?query=583#details` iron-location's properties will be:\n\n  - path: `'/search'`\n  - query: `'query=583'`\n  - hash: `'details'`\n\nThese bindings are bidirectional. Modifying them will in turn modify the URL.\n\niron-location is only active while it is attached to the document.\n\n#### Links\n\nWhile iron-location is active in the document it will intercept clicks on links\nwithin your site, updating the URL pushing the updated URL out through the\ndatabinding system. iron-location only intercepts clicks with the intent to\nopen in the same window, so middle mouse clicks and ctrl/cmd clicks work fine.\n\nYou can customize this behavior with the `urlSpaceRegex`.\n\n#### Dwell Time\n\niron-location protects against accidental history spamming by only adding\nentries to the user's history if the URL stays unchanged for `dwellTime`\nmilliseconds.\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n\n */\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

As changes\noccur, `app-location` produces and updates an object called `route`. This\n`route` object is suitable for passing into a `app-route`, and other similar\nelements.\n\nAn example of the public API of a route object that describes the URL\n`https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-location`:\n\n    {\n      prefix: '',\n      path: '/elements/app-location'\n    }\n\nExample Usage:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\"></app-location>\n    <app-route route=\"{{route}}\" pattern=\"/:page\" data=\"{{data}}\"></app-route>\n\nAs you can see above, the `app-location` element produces a `route` and that\nproperty is then bound into the `app-route` element. The bindings are two-\ndirectional, so when changes to the `route` object occur within `app-route`,\nthey automatically reflect back to the global location.\n\n### Hashes vs Paths\n\nBy default `app-location` routes using the pathname portion of the URL. This has\nbroad browser support but it does require cooperation of the backend server. An\n`app-location` can be configured to use the hash part of a URL instead using\nthe `use-hash-as-path` attribute, like so:\n\n    <app-location route=\"{{route}}\" use-hash-as-path></app-location>\n\n### Integrating with other routing code\n\nThere is no standard event that is fired when window.location is modified.\n`app-location` fires a `location-changed` event on `window` when it updates the\nlocation. It also listens for that same event, and re-reads the URL when it's\nfired. This makes it very easy to interop with other routing code.\n\nSo for example if you want to navigate to `/new_path` imperatively you could\ncall `window.location.pushState` or `window.location.replaceState` followed by\nfiring a `location-changed` event on `window`. i.e.\n\n    window.history.pushState({}, null, '/new_path');\n    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('location-changed'));\n\n@element app-location\n@demo demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.

When\nthe viewport width is smaller than `responsiveWidth`, this element changes to narrow layout.\nIn narrow layout, the drawer will be stacked on top of the main content. The drawer will slide\nin/out to hide/reveal the main content.\n\nBy default the drawer is aligned to the start, which is left in LTR layouts:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n    drawer content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <div>\n    main content\n  </div>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\nAlign the drawer at the end:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\" align=\"end\">\n     drawer content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <div>\n    main content\n  </div>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\nWith an app-header-layout:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n    drawer-content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <app-header-layout>\n    <app-header slot=\"header\">\n      <app-toolbar>\n        <div main-title>App name</div>\n      </app-toolbar>\n    </app-header>\n\n    main content\n\n  </app-header-layout>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\nAdd the `drawer-toggle` attribute to elements inside `app-drawer-layout` that toggle the drawer on click events:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n    drawer-content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <app-header-layout>\n    <app-header slot=\"header\">\n      <app-toolbar>\n        <paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\" drawer-toggle></paper-icon-button>\n        <div main-title>App name</div>\n      </app-toolbar>\n    </app-header>\n\n    main content\n\n  </app-header-layout>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\n**NOTE:** With app-layout 2.0, the `drawer-toggle` element needs to be manually hidden\nwhen app-drawer-layout is not in narrow layout. To add this, add the following CSS rule where\napp-drawer-layout is used:\n\n```css\napp-drawer-layout:not([narrow]) [drawer-toggle] {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\nAdd the `fullbleed` attribute to app-drawer-layout to make it fit the size of its container:\n\n```html\n<app-drawer-layout fullbleed>\n  <app-drawer slot=\"drawer\">\n     drawer content\n  </app-drawer>\n  <div>\n    main content\n  </div>\n</app-drawer-layout>\n```\n\n### Styling\n\nCustom property                          | Description                          | Default\n-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------\n`--app-drawer-width`                     | Width of the drawer                  | 256px\n`--app-drawer-layout-content-transition` | Transition for the content container | none\n\n**NOTE:** If you use <app-drawer> with <app-drawer-layout> and specify a value for\n`--app-drawer-width`, that value must be accessible by both elements. This can be done by\ndefining the value on the `:host` that contains <app-drawer-layout> (or `html` if outside\na shadow root):\n\n```css\n:host {\n  --app-drawer-width: 300px;\n}\n```\n\n@group App Elements\n@element app-drawer-layout\n@demo app-drawer-layout/demo/index.html\n*/\n/*\n  FIXME(polymer-modulizer): the above comments were extracted\n  from HTML and may be out of place here.
